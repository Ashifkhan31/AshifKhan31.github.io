    <p>
    I could write about something technical for my first article But I have decided against it and to talk about how I am feeling. 
    Its hard to put it into words about how I am feeling or why, because I am not sure about it myself. To put it simply, I don't feel excitement, enthusiasm or awe as I used to. <br> <br>
   
    It is maybe a effect of growing up. The things that once seemed magical has become mudane. The curiosity I once had is nowhere to be found.
    Maybe, this is just a phase. I found so much joy in this world even during the worst of times. I don't want to give it all up and be sad all day for nothing.
    Arguably, I am in my best times of my life. I have relatively less work than in school, more freedom etc. <br> <br>
    
    There is a old professor I watch on youtube who is absolutely passionate about math. He is probably around 50 years old. He would have seen much things and faced many discouragement.
    Yet, He still has that spirit in him. <br> <br> 

    Maybe, I am burned out from working too hard, who knows?. Emotions and feelings are fiddly things. All we can do is live through it and hope for the best.
