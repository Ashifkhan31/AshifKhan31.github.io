    <p><b>A few incoherent late night thoughts of mine</b> &nbsp-&nbsp 6/8/2025</p>
    
    <p>
    
    I have been thinking about writing something for my site because it has been a while
    since I have done anything with it and there isn’t any stuff in here to begin with.
    So, wanted to change that and I really didn’t want to write something
    just for the sake of writing. Yet, I wanted to write badly. I think its maybe
    because it satisfies my need for expressing myself. <br> <br>
    
    I think there so many stuff on the internet which are created with consumption in mind
    rather than people simply sharing stuff they like.
    Now, The norm is to consume and creating is done by only a select
    whose job is to cater the consumers. <br> <br>
    
    Mayhaps, I am a teensy bit egoistical but I do think my dumb rants hold
    enough value to deserve to be inside a html file, that is few KB big,
    tucked away in some corner of the internet. <br> <br>

    So, that’s all I guess. I will try to write more.

  const userAgent = navigator.userAgent;

    return "Mobile";

    return "Tablet";
  } else {
    return "Desktop";
  }

console.log(`Device Type: ${getDeviceType()}`);

if(getDeviceType() != "Desktop"){

   document.querySelector("h1").style.fontSize = "16px";

   var p = document.querySelectorAll("p");
   p.forEach(function(p) {
     p.style.fontSize = "14px";
}) 
  
  var img = document.querySelectorAll(".img-center");
  img.forEach(function(img){
    img.style.width = "100%";

  margin.style.marginLeft = "0.5%";
  margin.style.marginRight = "0.5%";
